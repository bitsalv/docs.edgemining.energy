# About Edge Mining

**Edge Mining** is a research-driven, open-source project that aims to revolutionize the way renewable energy producers manage surplus energy. By integrating Bitcoin mining as a dynamic and intelligent load, Edge Mining transforms energy that would otherwise be wasted into digital value.

## 🌱 Why We Exist

Energy systems—especially those powered by renewables—often face the challenge of overproduction during low-demand periods. Traditionally, producers had limited options: sell excess energy at low prices, store it in expensive batteries, or let it go to waste. Edge Mining introduces a new, economically viable, and technically simple path: convert that energy into Bitcoin.

## 🧠 Our Approach

We focus on developing a modular, intelligent software layer that:

- Monitors real-time energy availability and household consumption
- Dynamically controls ASIC mining devices based on optimization policies
- Maximizes energy efficiency and heat reuse through automation
- Integrates with existing energy systems, including inverters, batteries, and smart home platforms

Our software architecture is built following Domain-Driven Design (DDD) principles to ensure modularity, clarity, and scalability.

## 🔓 Open Source and Community-Led

Edge Mining is:
- 💡 100% Open Source
- 🔍 Transparent and auditable
- 🤝 Community-driven

We believe in building in the open, welcoming feedback, contributions, and critical insights from the broader community. Our goal is to create tools that empower small energy producers, makers, and researchers alike.
